# introstatacode
This is a .do-file running through basic descriptive statistics and measures of association in Stata for various kinds of combinations of categorical and quantitative predictor/outcome variables

I included the most recent wave of the GSS in here, so as long as you have Stata, you can download some example data and the code itself here. Then, just open the
data in Stata, open the code, hit "Do", and repeat the codes that seem most useful to your project, only with your own variables inserted. Make sure to read
my comments about the statistical theory behind these measures so that you know how to interpret them.
